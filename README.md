# vaccine-slot-alert
No hassle of checking for vaccine slot availability while working. Configure the requirements and receive browser notifications whenever the vaccine slots are available.

## Filters
Supported filters are `AGE LIMIT, FEE TYPE, VACCINE NAME, DOSE TYPE and DISTRICT`. Currently only filtering based on a single `district` is allowed (not `PINCODE` based), but soon `multiple districts` will be supported.

### Note
Verified for lastest versions of `Microsft Edge and Google Chrome`. A bug in these chromium based browsers doesn't show notifications if they were disabled at the time of installation, please reinstall the browser(only if one can afford). in such cases and allow notifications during new install.
